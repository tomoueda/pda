pda

progress:
Right now experimenting with python to see how much data I could gather, everything is printed
on the console.

The idea:
I realized that a lot of Puzzle and Dragons information/data websites only focus on the monsters individually. 
That's great and all, but the real fun of puzzle and dragons is figuring out what team to build and what
monsters work in synergy with other monsters.

That's why I'm working on pda, the puzzle dragon analyzer.

How it works: like other websites you could query for individual monsters but instead of listing stats and
other obvious information, this websites gathers team data on puzzledragonx dungeon pages to list out
the monster's relation with other monsters. This way when you do roll your highly coveted god monsters from
the REM you could immediately see what other monsters you should be farming for and get a clearer picture
of where your new god monster fits in your teams.
